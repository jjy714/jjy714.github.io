### **Projects**

**Machine Learning: Custom CNN for Hand Gesture Recognition**  (Hanyang University, 2023)
- Preprocessed gesture image data and implemented a custom convolutional neural network.  
- Achieved accurate classification of numerical hand signs through supervised learning.

**WFL Mobile App: Restaurant Recommendation System**  (Hanyang University, 2024)
- Designed intuitive UI/UX using React Native and integrated Google Maps API.  
- Built backend services with Django and implemented database connection for location-based suggestions.  
- Evaluated user behavior to inform iterative UI improvements.

**Software Engineering: Top-Down System Architecture Design**  (Hanyang University, 2024)
- Created detailed waterfall-model plans for a proposed software system.  
- Developed UML-based static and dynamic component models for system documentation.

**LLM Evaluation Benchmark System (Claion, 2025)**  
- Developed a standardized benchmarking system for evaluating small language models (SLMs) across reasoning, summarization, instruction-following, and RAG tasks.  
- Automated the evaluation pipeline using Python, Hugging Face, and custom metrics reporting for repeatable testing.  
- Compared commercial and open-source models to guide product integration decisions.

**Real-Time Speech Denoising (Claion, 2025)**  
- Designed and trained a model to isolate speaker voice from background noise in online meetings.  
- Integrated the system into a prototype meeting assistant application; improved voice clarity by >30% in internal tests.  
- Utilized PyTorch, torchaudio, and custom signal processing pipelines.

**Asynchronous RAG Evaluation System (Claion, 2025)**
- Architected and developed a complete, independent solution to conduct asynchronous, concurrent evaluations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
- Authored formal functional requirements, system sequence diagrams, and user flow diagrams to define the system architecture.
- Engineered a Docker-based microservice infrastructure, using FastAPI to manage API ports for each component.
- Implemented an innovative isolation process that instantiates a target RAG system with a temporary Qdrant vector collection, enabling focused evaluation and exponentially reducing testing time.
- Utilized MongoDB as the relational database for storing comprehensive evaluation results and system metadata.
- Integrated a robust suite of standard evaluation metrics, including BLEU, ROUGE for generation quality, and MRR, MAP, Precision, F1-score, and NDCG for retrieval performance.

**SLM Fine-Tuning for Tool-Calling Function Injection (Claion/Lab Research, 2025)**
- Led a dedicated research task to deeply analyze Small Language Model (SLM) architectures and explore methods for injecting tool-calling capabilities.
- Focused on a comparative study of models including Gemma, Exaone, and HCX DASH, with the primary goal of modifying them to understand and execute tool-use functions.
- Employed efficient PEFT/LoRA fine-tuning techniques, leveraging the Unsloth library to train models on three distinct open-source datasets from Hugging Face.
- Engineered and modified model-specific chat templates to enable tool-calling syntax and logic in models that lacked native support.
