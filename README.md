### **Projects**

**Machine Learning: Custom CNN for Hand Gesture Recognition**  
- Preprocessed gesture image data and implemented a custom convolutional neural network.  
- Achieved accurate classification of numerical hand signs through supervised learning.

**WFL Mobile App: Restaurant Recommendation System**  
- Designed intuitive UI/UX using React Native and integrated Google Maps API.  
- Built backend services with Django and implemented database connection for location-based suggestions.  
- Evaluated user behavior to inform iterative UI improvements.

**Software Engineering: Top-Down System Architecture Design**  
- Created detailed waterfall-model plans for a proposed software system.  
- Developed UML-based static and dynamic component models for system documentation.


**LLM Evaluation Benchmark System (Claion, 2025)**  
- Developed a standardized benchmarking system for evaluating small language models (SLMs) across reasoning, summarization, instruction-following, and RAG tasks.  
- Automated the evaluation pipeline using Python, Hugging Face, and custom metrics reporting for repeatable testing.  
- Compared commercial and open-source models to guide product integration decisions.

**Real-Time Speech Denoising (Claion, 2025)**  
- Designed and trained a model to isolate speaker voice from background noise in online meetings.  
- Integrated the system into a prototype meeting assistant application; improved voice clarity by >30% in internal tests.  
- Utilized PyTorch, torchaudio, and custom signal processing pipelines.
